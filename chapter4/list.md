# Python lists are containers to store a set of values of any datatypes.

# A list can be indexed just like a string

# Slicing is just like string

# list didn't generate new list when method is applied list modified existed list and string generate new string when method is applied string remains original string. 

# Lists are mutable: Methods that modify a list change the original list without creating a new one.
# Strings are immutable: Methods that seem to modify a string actually return a new string, leaving the original string unchanged.
